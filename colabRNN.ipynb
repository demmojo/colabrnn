For example, in TensorFlow’s Magenta implementation of LSTMs, temperature represents how much to divide the logits by before computing the softmax.\n",

        "When the temperature is 1, we compute the softmax directly on the logits (the unscaled output of earlier layers), and using a temperature of 0.6 the model computes the softmax on logits0.6, resulting in a larger value. Performing softmax on larger values makes the LSTM more confident (less input is needed to activate the output layer) but also more conservative in its samples (it is less likely to sample from unlikely candidates). Using a higher temperature produces a softer probability distribution over the classes, and makes the RNN more “easily excited” by samples, resulting in more diversity and also more mistakes."
